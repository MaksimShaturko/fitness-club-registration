		FITNESS CLUB REGISTRATION
		
	The application simulates the registration of a user in a Fitness club.

	With the help of reflection, we refer to the fields of the
	FitnessClubMember class.
	The user needs to enter the value of each field.

	There is an annotation @ValidDataEntering above each field of the class. Each
	annotation field is used to output messages to the user and validate them.

	The user enters the requested data into the console, the program checks it.
	If the input is incorrect, the data is requested to be re-entered until
	the correct value will be entered.

	After validation, the entered value write to a file. And so it is with
	each value of each field of the FitnessClubMember class
	1. After the user completes entering data, the program reads the data from
	the  file and enters it into the List and Map.

	2. After writing the fields entered by the user to the file, an
	FitnessClubMember object is created and this object write to a separate
	file Members.bin

	After writing all the objects to the file, we read the objects from the
	file and add them to the List. We display the List on the screen.
